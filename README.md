# StreamMart
### Project Context 
StreamMart enables sellers to live stream product demos, buyers to interact in real time via chat, and make instant purchases during the stream. To avoid the “live-only” limitation, StreamMart is hybrid: 
- Live shopping (real-time video + chat + instant checkout), 
- Replay shopping (recordings saved; products remain purchasable with dynamic stock), 
- Always-on product pages (classic e-commerce listing with images, specs, and embedded video snippets/highlights). 
- The platform includes AI-generated product descriptions, personalized recommendations, and full CRUD-based e-commerce.
